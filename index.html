                        You were trick-or-treating when the door to the house blew open mysteriously and a voice called you in. You assumed for the candy. Turns out: only nightmares.

                    <label>

                        You've always felt uneasy about the house, but the resident <em>cool kid</em> said you might be <em>cool enough</em> for the <em>cool party</em> if you spent the night in the nightmare house.

                        With the cost of living rapidly on the rise, you couldn't turn down the incredible deal you got from a old man you've never seen before who gave you the house for free on condition that you signed the contract in a teensy bit of blood.

                        <img src="assets/monster.jpg" height=100px>
                        You're just a misunderstood monster who thought the gig haunting the nightmare house sounded fun at the time, but now you're a slave to the grind and you're ready to follow your real passion: photography.
